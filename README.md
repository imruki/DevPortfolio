# DevPortfolio

DevPortfolio is my personal portfolio website designed to showcase my projects, skills, and professional experience. The site is built with PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
The Website is not yet finished, I am planning on hosting it on Heroku or a similar platform as soon as it is ready for showcase.

## Highlights
- Project showcases with detailed descriptions and links
- About Me section highlighting my background and skills
- Contact information for potential clients or employers
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on any device
